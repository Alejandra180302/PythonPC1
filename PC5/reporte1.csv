16331,Portugal,"This 1967 is part of Taylor Fladgate's regular releases of aged Colheita. It is showing a perfect moment in which the fruit finally passes into old gold maturity. The wine still has hints of sultanas, but now it's the fine wood and spice character that is equally important. The wine, of course, is ready to drink and will not age further.",Single Harvest,94,300.0,Port,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Taylor Fladgate 1967 Single Harvest  (Port),Port,Taylor Fladgate				,,94000,16.919999999999998
46010,Portugal,"One of a series of releases by this Port producer, this Colheita, or Port from a single harvest, is beautifully poised between red fruits and mature almond and an old gold character. It has intensity, a product of the aging in wood that has just concentrated the wine. Like all Ports of this type, it is ready to drink.",Single Harvest,95,300.0,Port,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Taylor Fladgate 1968 Single Harvest  (Port),Port,Taylor Fladgate				,,95000,17.099999999999998
56043,Portugal,"This is the latest release of Portugal's most iconic wine. It's made only in selected years (the last vintage was 2000) from Ferreira's Quinta da Leda in the Douro Superior. This new vintage is superb. It's a richly tarry wine laden with dark plum fruits and tannins that are just beginning to mature. It's a ripe and luscious, demanding attention, yet will still age for many years. Drink now, or hold until 2020.",Barca Velha,99,426.0,Douro,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Casa Ferreirinha 2004 Barca Velha Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Casa Ferreirinha				,,99000,17.82
42197,Portugal,This is the latest release of what has long been regarded as Portugal's iconic wine. And it is magnificent. The last vintage was the 2004 and the wait has now shown to be worthwhile. With its immense span and breadth of flavors and rich structure it is a superb manifestation of the great vineyards of the Douro Superior. Big bold fruits and acidity are matched by the tannins and concentration. Hold this for many years or at least wait until 2022.,Barca-Velha,100,450.0,Douro,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Casa Ferreirinha 2008 Barca-Velha Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Casa Ferreirinha				,,100000,18.0
52636,Portugal,"Perfectly mature, this Port's tannins have softened over the past 40-plus years, leaving it lushly textured and displaying rich fig and chocolate flavors. Finishes long, picking up a touch of almond to go with the fig, flavors Symington calls â€œDow's hallmarks.â€ Drink nowâ€“2015, longer if you prefer very mature wines.",Vintage,95,467.0,Port,,,,,Dow's 1963 Vintage  (Port),Port,Dow's				,,95000,17.099999999999998
56046,Portugal,"Properly old gold in color, this is a wine from a single year, aged in casks. It's poised between amazing fruit and a wonderful velvet texture that is shot through with acidity. A feeling of lightness comes from the acidity that gives great freshness as well as complex flavors.

It also has preserved an amazing amount of freshness still suggesting orange marmalade flavors. These are backed up by the fine, concentrated old wood tastes. The wine is, of course, ready to drink.",Colheita White,94,980.0,Port,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Kopke 1935 Colheita White  (Port),Port,Kopke				,,94000,16.919999999999998

It is impressively youthful even hinting at fruit. Of course, the concentration is intense and the richness is gorgeous. At the end, the acidity of a mature wine gives a shot of essential freshness.
